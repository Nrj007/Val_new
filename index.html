            <h1 class="letter-title">My Love,</h1>

            <p class="letter-text">I still smile when I think about how unexpected all of this was.</p>

            <p class="letter-text">The way we met, the way we slowly found our way into each other's lives, none of it
                was planned, yet somehow it feels like it was always meant to happen.</p>

            <p class="letter-text">Falling in love with you happened quietly and suddenly at the same time. One day you
                were just someone special, and the next, you were my safe place. You've changed me in ways I never
                imagined. I'm happier now than I ever was before — happier, calmer, and more hopeful, simply because
                you're in my life.</p>

            <p class="letter-text">I know I'm not perfect. There are times I've hurt you, even without meaning to, and
                for that I'm truly sorry. Please know that it never came from a lack of love. If anything, it comes from
                still learning how to love you better, the way you deserve.</p>

            <p class="letter-text">What I do know for sure is this: I want us. I want to face every hardship, every
                challenge, every storm together. I believe in us, in our bond, and in the love we share. No matter how
                hard things get, I hope we always choose each other.</p>

            <p class="letter-text">Thank you for loving me, for standing by me, and for being you.</p>

            <p class="letter-text">I hope we keep walking hand in hand, growing, healing, and loving until the very end.
            </p>
